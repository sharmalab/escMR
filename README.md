# escMR: Exam Series Categorization for MR Images.


# Project Name: A Framework And Methodology To Categorize Exam Series.

## Description

This project was developed as part of the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2023](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/oC59dZpT) program. The primary objective of this project is to create a robust framework and methodology for categorizing MRI exam series of the brain based on DICOM metadata. Additionally, the framework aims to perform compliance checks on MRI Brain Studies.
